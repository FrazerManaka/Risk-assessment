This project structure provides a solid foundation for a bank risk assessment tool. Here's a brief explanation of each component:


1.It loads data from a CSV file (you'll need to provide this file).
2.It preprocesses the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3.It performs feature engineering by calculating financial ratios and creating risk indicators.
4.It trains a Random Forest model to predict risk scores.
5.It generates a risk report and visualizes the distribution of risk scores.

To use this program:


1.Prepare a CSV file named bank_data.csv with the following columns:

Numerical: 'age', 'balance', 'income', 'duration'
Categorical: 'job', 'marital', 'education', 'default', 'housing', 'loan'
Target variable: 'y' (binary, indicating default or not)


2.Run the script using Python: python bank_risk_assessment.py

The program will output a model performance report, a risk assessment summary, and save a visualization of the risk score distribution.
